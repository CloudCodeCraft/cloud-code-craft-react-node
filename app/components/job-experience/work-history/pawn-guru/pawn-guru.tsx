              Implemented Google Sign-In to streamline user onboarding and
              reduce friction in the signup flow. Integrated OAuth
              authentication into the React frontend and Django backend, and
              securely mapped existing Gmail-based accounts to enable seamless
              login and account creation.

              Refactored a legacy React component library originally built with
              outdated wrapper patterns over Material UI and Formik. Removed
              unnecessary abstractions, improving maintainability, readability,
              and modular structure of the codebase.

              Rebuilt core UI components using native Material UI elements and
              React hooks to improve first-paint performance, reduce unnecessary
              re-renders, and eliminate flaky behavior in headless test
              environments. The refactor also reduced bundle size and
              accelerated development cycles.

              Led a redesign and A/B testing initiative for the companyâ€™s lead
              generation forms. Collaborated with product and UX teams to launch
              multiple variants and analyze performance, resulting in a 30%
              increase in lead conversions driven by data-informed UI
              improvements.
