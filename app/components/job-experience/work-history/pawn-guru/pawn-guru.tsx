              Implemented Google Sign-In to streamline user onboarding and
              improve lead conversion rates. The project involved integrating
              OAuth on the React front end, verifying tokens securely in the
              Django backend, and linking existing Gmail-based accounts to the
              new auth system. This reduced friction in the signup process and
              increased first-time user engagement.

              Modernized a legacy in-house React component library that was
              built with outdated wrapper patterns on top of Material UI and
              Formik. Removed unnecessary abstractions, improving
              maintainability, readability, and modularity across the codebase.

              Leveraged React hooks and direct usage of Material UI components
              to reduce unnecessary re-renders, improve first-paint performance,
              and eliminate flaky behaviors in headless testing environments.
              The refactor also sped up development cycles and reduced bundle
              size.

              Led a redesign and A/B testing initiative for the platformâ€™s lead
              generation form. Collaborated with product and UX teams to test
              multiple variations, resulting in a 30% increase in user
              conversions.
